      # Terms of Service for Coin Op
      <br />
      _Last Updated: September 5, 2023_
      <br /> <br />
      ## Introduction
      <br />
      Welcome to Coin Op. By opting for this platform, you are aligning with a
      vision of personal autonomy, open-source technology, and public domain
      creativity. These Terms of Service (ToS) govern the use of various
      decentralized services (Services).
      <br /> <br />
      ## Acceptance of Terms
      <br />
      By accessing or using our Services, you agree to follow and be bound by
      these terms, making them a mutual agreement between you and Coin Op.
      <br /> <br />
      ## Our Ethos: Decentralization at its Core
      <br />
      Coin Op is built on the principles of the cypherpunk movement, emphasizing
      personal autonomy, privacy, and decentralized technology. Our platform
      leverages the cutting edge in decentralization—from asset storage to
      opt-in social media integration via Lens Protocol.
      <br /> <br />
      ## Our Services
      <br />
      We offer a decentralized platform for creating and purchasing custom and
      pre-made streetwear and street art prints, facilitated by AI diffusion
      models. We also provide prerolls of prints and apparel.
      <br /> <br />
      ### User Requirements
      <br />
      - You must be at least 13 years old to use our Services. - You agree to
      provide accurate information during transactions.
      <br /> <br />
      ### User-Generated Content: Navigating the Frontier of Public Domain
      <br />
      While the legal status of AI-generated works remains a subject of ongoing
      debate and litigation, Coin Op takes a proactive stance by releasing all
      such content into the public domain upon creation. This aligns with the
      ethos underpinning copyright law, which aims to foster scientific progress
      and artistic expression, rather than monopolizing the basic elements of
      creativity. By using the Services, you agree to contribute your
      creations—whether AI-generated or otherwise—to the public domain. This
      liberates these works from all copyright and proprietary restrictions,
      allowing anyone to use them for any purpose. You thereby waive all
      copyright and related rights in your contributions to the fullest extent
      possible under the law, enriching a shared digital commons.
      <br /> <br />
      ### Payments: Flexibility and Autonomy
      <br />
      For debit and credit card transactions, we currently use Stripe as our
      primary payment processor, although we reserve the right to switch or add
      payment processing providers. In the spirit of financial autonomy and
      decentralization, we also accept payments in various EVM-based tokens,
      including $ETH, $USDT, $MONA, and $MATIC. To make a token payment, you&apos;ll
      need a self-custody wallet like Rainbow, Metamask, or Coinbase Wallet. By
      using these payment methods, you agree to the respective terms and
      conditions of these payment processors and wallets.
      <br /> <br />
      #### Tax Implications for Token Payments
      <br />
      If you choose to make payments using EVM-based tokens, you are solely
      responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes associated with
      such transactions. Different jurisdictions have varying tax rules relating
      to the use of tokens for payments, and it&apos;s your responsibility to
      understand and comply with these. Coin Op is not responsible for reporting
      or paying taxes on your behalf for token-based transactions.
      <br /> <br />
      ## Refunds and Returns
      <br />
      All sales are final, given the custom nature of many of our products.
      Exceptions may be made at our discretion for damaged or defective items,
      which must be reported within 7 days of receipt.
      <br /> <br />
      ## Security: Decentralized and Robust
      <br />
      In line with our commitment to decentralization, we employ Programmable
      Key Pairs (PKP) and Lit Actions decentralized encryption technology,
      ensuring the utmost security for your data.
      <br /> <br />
      ## Liability
      <br />
      Coin Op shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
      consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of
      profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from
      your access to or use of the Service.
      <br /> <br />

      data collection, usage, and protection measures.

      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services
      for behavior we deem detrimental to other users, us, or third parties.
